# MovieListings

I implemented in Angular for speed
To setup this project you'll need to install
@angular/cli: [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4
Node v9.6.1
NPM 6.4.0
Do an `npm install`
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. `http://localhost:4200/`

The API is paginated and appears to return movies ordered by popularity, so I didn't modify the order

This implementation is rushed, a little buggy, and lacking unit tests. Can't say I'm proud of it...
